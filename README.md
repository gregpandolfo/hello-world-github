github guide hello-world

The guide says to write a bit about myself.  My name is Gregory Pandolfo.  I am doing the github repository guide as part of a larger experiment in understanding, demonstrating and documentating my experience using a set of "current" tools and options.  I have been writing code for over 20 years now, although often mostly integrating large amounts of exisitng code, open source projects, tools, frameworks, and the like.  My current goal is to see what interesting things I can do.
